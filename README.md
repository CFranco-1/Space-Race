# Video Game Programming Final - Space Race
# Created by Cesar Franco

This game is called Space Race where the character controls Superman as they shoot their way out a field of asteroids. You'll notice this is a different concept then what I wrote in my GDD. This was my original idea, but I was struggling with collision so I decided against it. Did some research and figured it out so I hope the change of concept is okay because I think this idea is cooler anyway
